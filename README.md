RainbowPlant inventory storage tool.
This an ASP.NET Core MVC web development with controllers and views application project. 
It is intended to help the user to track an inventory of trees and bushes at RainbowPlant store. 
The user can add/post a new arrived inventory item, get or update details on a particular item and delete an item.

Description of functionality: 
The application opens a Home page with a link to Inventory list. 
The Inventory list page currently has a list of 6 plants with fields: Plant ID, Plant Description, Date Delivered, Quantity, Unit Price. 
Each inventory line has 3 option: Edit, Update, Delete. 
On the top of the page there is an option to add a new inventory item. 

Feature requirements implemented in this project:

1. Implement a regular expression (regex). I implemented a regex to validate Unit Price field to insure there is only 2 decimal places.  
2. Made a CRUD MVC application. 
3.	Add comments to your code explaining how you're using at least 2 of the solid principles (still working to add) 

And most likely I will add unit tests.
